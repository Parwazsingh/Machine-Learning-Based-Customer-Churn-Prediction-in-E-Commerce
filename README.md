# Machine-Learning-Based-Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-E-Commerce

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the e-commerce sector using machine learning techniques. The research paper by Mr. Parwaz Singh Sarao, Mr. Pushpendu Arunkumar Samanta, and Ms. Maria Nancy from SRM Institute of Science and Technology forms the basis of this work. It emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of retaining existing customers in e-commerce and employs various machine learning models for churn prediction.

## Data Description
The data comprises transactional and demographic details of e-commerce customers. Key attributes include purchase history, payment methods, customer demographics like age, gender, income, education, and location.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves data cleaning and optimization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses statistical and graphical methods to analyze data patterns and trends.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, KNN, XGBoost, and Random Forest.
- **SMOTE Oversampling**: Addresses imbalanced datasets by creating synthetic minority class samples.

## Results and Conclusion
The project demonstrates high accuracy in churn prediction, with Random Forest showing the best performance. The study's insights help in strategizing customer retention effectively in e-commerce.

## Libraries and Tools
- Python
